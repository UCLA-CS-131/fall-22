## Map, Filter and Reduce (continued)

### Reducers (foldl/foldr)

Let's look at the last kind of the three: reducer. A reducer is a function that combines the values in an input list to produce a single output value.

Each reducer takes three inputs:

1. A function that processes each of the elements
2. An initial "accumulator" value
3. A list of items to operate on

Haskell has two different reducer functions: `foldl` and `foldr`. Let's learn about both!

Let's first look at the pseudocode for `foldl`

{: .note }
To ease the understanding, this version is not functional code yet. We will see the real functional implementation later.

```
foldl(f, initial_accum, lst):
  accum = initial_accum
  for each x in lst:
    accum = f(accum, x)
  return accum
```

The core logic of `foldl` all happens around the accumulator variable `accum`:

- It is first set with the initial value `initial_accum`, the second argument to the function. The initial value can often be 0, 1 or an empty list
- Next, the `accum` is updated as we loop through each item the list. Each time the function `f` is used to "accumulate" the item to `accum`.
- In the end, the final value of `accum` is returned.

Here is one example `f` function for foldl (this time we use C++-like code to specify the typing):

```cpp
int f1(int accum, int x)
  { return accum + x; }
```

If the function `f1` is used in place of argument `f`, `foldl` computes the sum of list `lst`. When in doubt, create an example and try to evaluate with hand with the pseudocode!

The logic of `foldr` is similar to `foldl` with small changes. Here is its pseudocode:

```
foldr(f, initial_accum, lst):
  accum = initial_accum
  for each x in lst from back to front:
    accum = f(x, accum)
  return accum
```

There are two differences between `foldr` and `foldl`:

- The iteration order of list is reversed in `foldr`
- The order of arguments of `f` are different

Now let's see the Haskell code for `foldl`:

```hs
foldl f accum [] = accum
foldl f accum (x:xs) =
  foldl f new_accum xs
 where new_accum = (f accum x)

foldr f accum [] = accum 
foldr f accum (x:xs) = 
  f x (foldr f accum xs) 
```

As you can see, each new value x is "folded" into the accumulator as it's processed.

- `foldl` is left-associative: `f( ... f(f(accum,x1),x2), ..., xn)`
- `foldr` is right-associative: `f(x1, f(x2, ... f(xn, accum) ... ))`

On the other hand, `foldr` is right-associative.

### Influencer Alert!!

Nowadays, virtually all modern languages now implement the map-filter-reduce paradigm. Here are some examples from Python, Java and Javascript

```python
# Python map-reduce example
def adder(a,b):
  return a + b

nums = [1, 4, 9, 16]
roots = map(sqrt, nums)

sum_of_roots = reduce(adder, roots)
```

```java
// Java map-reduce example
List<Double> nums =
  Arrays.asList(1.0, 4.0, 9.0, 16.0);

double sum_of_roots = nums.stream()
        .map((n) -> Math.sqrt(n))
        .reduce(0, Double::sum);
```

```js
// JavaScript map-reduce example
function adder(total, num) 
 { return total + num; }

var nums = [1, 4, 9, 16];
var roots = nums.map(Math.sqrt);
var sum_of_roots = roots.reduce(adder, 0);
```

Moreover, these functions form a new paradigm that has radically transformed the Internet, medicine, autonomous vehicles, and virtually every other field.

While mapping, filtering and reducing seem marginally useful when running on a small list of items on a single computer, they can be applied to a huge cluster of servers to process massive amount of data.

All of this is possible because these are pure functions that are stateless, so they can be run in parallel!

## Advanced Topics in Functional Programming

Now we are in the Functional Programming home stretch, where we are learning some more advanced functional programming. Many concepts covered here are actually the core of FP, and that's where things get interesting~

### Lambda and Closure

We start from lambda functions. By definition, a lambda function is just like any other function, but it _does not have a function name_.

For example, the corresponding lambda function of a normal function `cube x = x^3` is `\x -> x^3` in Haskell. The two functions are identical except the second does not have a name. Calling `(\x -> x^3) 3` gives you the same result as `cube 3`.

{: .note }
Having lambda function is just another manifestation that functions are the first-class citizens in functional programming languages. It allows functions to be written as values without giving them name, just like values of other types (integers, strings, etc.)

People may wonder what practical benefit lambda function can bring. Sometimes it can make code easier to read. We can use lambdas in higher-order functions with we don't want to bother defining a whole new named function.

For example, with lambda, we can create the following functions:

```hs
squarer lst = map (\x -> x^2) lst
cuber lst = map (\x -> x^3) lst
```

The `squarer` and `cuber` functions computes the square and cube of each item within the list. We don't need to define separate helper functions and the logic can be understood by looking at the one-liner code.

Ok, let's learn the syntax for defining a lambda function in Haskell. A lambda expression in Haskell is written as `\param_1 ... param_n -> expression`

- The lambda function starts with a backslash (`\`). It is chosen because its resemblence with the Greek letter lambda.
- Then you specify the name of one or more parameters, specified by spaces. These are called _bound_ variables.
- The dash-greater sequence (`->`) follows the list of parameters, separates them with the rest of lambda.
- Finally, we have the function's expression, which is what the function computes and returns.

Let's see some examples in the Haskell interpreter:

```console
ghci> (\x y -> x^3+y^2) 10 3
1009
```

Unfortunately we can't just define a lambda function in the interpreter because it will cause an error. But we can call the lambda function we created.

In the example above, we create a lambda expression and call it with arguments `x=10` and `y=3`. Thus it computes `10^3+3^2` and returns 1009.

Here are two examples with `map`:

```console
ghci> map (\x -> 1/x) [3..5]
[0.3333333333333333,0.25,0.2]
ghci> map (\x -> take 2 x) ["Dog", "Cat"]
["Do","Ca"]
```

Also, we can assign a lambda function to a variable. After the assignment, we can call lambda just like we would call any other function.

```console
ghci> a_func = \x y -> x++y
ghci> a_func [1,2,3] [4,5]
[1,2,3,4,5]
```

{: .note }
Some may wonder, does assigning lambda to variable defeat the purpose of having _anonymous_ function? In Boyan's opinion, it does seem so. However, looking from another angle, lambda functions can be regarded as more fundamental than named functions. Defining named function like `a_func x y = x ++ y` can be regarded as syntatic sugar of `a_func = \x y -> x ++ y`.

Next, let's look at a fancier usage of lambda expression: using it to generate new functions! Look at the following code:

```hs
-- lambda.hs
wrapFuncWithAbs func = (\x -> abs (func x))

cubed x = x^3
twox = 2*x
```

Our function accepts an input function `func`, it builds a new function that computes `y=abs(func(x))` and returns that new function as output.

```console
ghci> :load lambda
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( lambda.hs, interpreted )
ghci> abs2x = wrapFuncWithAbs twox
ghci> abs2x (-42)
84
ghci> abscube = wrapFuncWithAbs (\z -> z^3)
27
```

Both `abs2x` and `abscube` are created from return values of `wrapFuncWithAbs` functions.

- The returned lambda assigned to `abs2x` is `\x -> abs (twox x)`
- Meanwhile, `abscube` is `\x -> abs ((\z -> z^3) x)`

Neat, right? We just generated two new functions from scratch!
