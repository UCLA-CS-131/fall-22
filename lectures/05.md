Hey everyone, Ashwin here. This continues from [last lecture]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/04), and covers the slides from python_intro_v1 from 1 to 19. The first part of this lecture (Algebraic Data Types and Immutability) are currently in progress.

Note: In a code block, the characters below `-------------` represents the output of the Python program above the `-------------`. 

For example:
```
<python program>

<output of python program>
```
# Intro to Python

## Background

Python uses: 
- quick and dirty scripting
- industrial scripts

Basic Python facts: 
- open source
- no compiler, just interpreters (we will use CPython)
- Avoid Python for: writing efficient programs (since it's interpreted)
  -  note: Python modules can use code from other languages (e.g. C++) for optimization (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy)

### Python Shell

Python Shell can be used: 
- interactively
- to run programs saved in `.py` files
```
climberkip$ python3
Python 3.9.6
<a bunch more boilerplate removed for clarity>
>>> def f(x,y):
...  print(f'{x} + {y} is {x+y}')
... 
>>> f(10,20)
10 + 20 is 30
>>> bar = 10
>>> bar/3 + 5
8.3333333333333334
>>> ^D
```
 - `...` indicates multi-line function
- exit shell with Ctrl-D or `quit()`

## Basic Intro, through Challenges

`import this` => Python Design Principles [link](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)

- **Formatting**: blocks defined by colon + indentation; no block delimiter `{` or statement delimiter `;`
- **Program Execution**: Interpreter runs file from top-to-bottom; no default main() function

Pythonic main function: 
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```
- Python sets `__name__` to `__main__`, telling us to run main function

- **Functions**: 
  - no parameter type annotation or return types
  - default params allowed; we can explicitly specify param names when calling functions

ex: 
```
def smoosh(x,y): 
  return x + y 

print(smoosh(y=10,x=20))
```
This returns `30`

### Variables and Types
- definition not required; type not required; variables can be assigned to different types over time
  - same function can be applied to different types

ex: overloaded `+` operator for strings and ints 
```
def add_n_print(x,y): 
  print(x+y)
  
 add_n_print(10,20)
 add_n_print("I <3 ", " coding")
```

**Type Errors + Dynamic Type Checking**
```
def add_n_print(x, y):
 print(x + y)              # Line 1

def main():
 add_n_print('foo', 5)     # Line 2
```
Error:
```
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```
Error is generated when the code reaches line #1 at runtime, after `add_n_print` is called from the main function.

{: .note }
Python uses dynamic checking, versus statically typed languages like C++. Dynamic checking means we only check the operand types the moment the operation occurs.

Python type hints are **NEVER** enforced by Python interpreter, although they are used by 3rd party tools and are considered good practice.

The following code runs fine: 
```
def make_bday_msg(name: str, age: int) -> str:
  msg: str = f'Happy {age}th birthday, {name}!'
  return msg

say_this: str = make_bday_msg(3.14159, 'hamsters')
print(say_this)
```

And prints: 
```
Happy hamstersth birthday, 3.14159!
```

**More Python Syntax**

Python has big ints that can hold any size integer; the array representing the integer can dynamically grow to any size.  
```
THRESHOLD = 1000000000
big = 2**200   # exponentiation
if big > THRESHOLD:
  print(f'{big} is really big!')

```
- all caps variables can be considered constants, although they can be reassigned, so technically not constants

- `/` operator always produces a double result: `//` always produces an integer result (integer division)
```
kittens = 5 / 2 #2.5
puppies = 5 // 2 #2
```

- Python's `input()` function always returns a string
  - we can convert to different types with `float()` or `int()`
```
#assume input is Binh 3.62 18 [each on a different line]
nm = input('Your name: ')
print(f'{nm} is {type(nm)}')
gpa = float(input('Your GPA: '))
print(f'{gpa} is {type(gpa)}')
age = int(input('Your age: '))
print(f'{age} is {type(age)}')
---
Your name: Binh
Binh is <class 'str'>
Your GPA: 3.62
3.62 is <class 'float'>
Your age: 18
10 is <class 'int'>
```
