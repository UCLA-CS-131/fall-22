## Strings!
- In Python, each string is an object just like our Circle objects!
- Strings are **immutable**, meaning they can't be modified once created.

```
fact1 = 'Del Taco rules! '
fact2 = 'CS131 is lit! '

truth = fact1 + fact2

truth += 'I have spoken.'
```
- The code to the left appears to mutate the string referred to by truth.
- This line looks like it mutates the object referred to by truth - but in reality, it creates a **NEW** string object!
  - Then it changes the object reference to point at the new object!
  - At some later time, our original string is garbage collected!
- Python generates/trashes lots of objects as your code runs – and you don't even know it!

### Substrings
```
# String slicing in Python
truth = 'UCLA students are awesome!'
print(truth[6]) #t
print(truth[1:3]) #CL    
print(truth[:4]) #UCLA 
print(truth[22:]) # some!
print(truth[-4:-1]) # ome
```
- substring of length 1 from `a`: `str[a]`
- substring from indices `[a-b)`: `str[a:b]`
  - when first param is empty, 0 is assumed: `str[:b]` is the same as `str[0:b]`
  - when the second param is empty, End is assumed: `str[a:]` <-> `str[a:End+1]`
- negative indices: represent relative to the end of the string
  - `str[-1]` is the last character in str
  - `str[:-1]` == `str[:len(str)-1]`

### Cool String Functions
- `strip(delimiter)` splits a string into an array of strings based on a delimiter (defaults to whitespace)
- `upper(x)` returns x all uppercase

## Lists
- Like strings, lists are objects in Python – and they support the same operations as strings!
- But, **lists are mutable**!

{: .note }
Assignment still creates a whole new object, despite lists being mutable. For example, `stuff = stuff + ['subpar']` creates a new `stuff` list. 

```
stuff = [42, False, 'walnuts']

stuff[2] = 'USC students'
stuff[0:2] = ["It's", 4, 'real']
stuff.append('are')    # or stuff += ['are']

stuff = stuff + ['subpar']
print(stuff[3:])
if 'walnuts' not in stuff:
  for s in stuff:
    print(s)
------------------------------
['USC students', 'are', 'subpar']
It's
4
real
USC students
are
subpar
```

### List Implementation + Complexity
- Accessing the jth element of a list, e.g., x[j] is super fast!
- Lists are implemented with dynamically-allocated arrays of object references.

**big-O**
- `in` and `not in`: `O(n)`
- `list[j]` where j is large: `O(1)`
- appending one list to another: `O(m+n)`

### Lists of Lists
```
x = [1,2]
lol = [[1],x]
x = [2]
print(x)
-------
[[1],[1,2]]
```
In `x = [2]`, we **re-assign** x, and hence it doesn't affect our original list `lol`!

## Tuples
Python tuples are immutable, ordered groups of items, e.g.,  
`([1,2,3],False)`, `(1,True,'foo')`, etc.

## Sets
- sets can only contain unique elements
- operations: `.add`, `.remove`

```
draining = set()

draining.add('CS131')
draining.add('dating')
draining.add('studying')
draining.remove('CS131')
print(draining)

if 'CS131' not in draining:
  print('Studying for CS131 is NOT draining!')

# Let's create a set from a list...
dinner = ['salad','soup','steak','soup','pie']
dinner_set = set(dinner)
print(f'Unique foods: {dinner_set}')
---------------------------------
{'dating', 'studying'}
Studying for CS131 is NOT draining!
Unique foods: {'soup', 'steak', 'pie', 'salad'}
```

- Python sets hold a single unique copy of each value
- sets are unordered
- Python uses hash table for sets

### more Python set operations
- `-` is difference
-  `|` is union
-  `&` is intersection

## Dictionaries
- Python has first-class support for dictionaries (maps) – they're super fast!
- Note: Python dictionaries are insertion-ordered as of Python 3.7, but sets are still unordered. [relevant Campuswire post](https://campuswire.com/c/G66F8C62D/feed)
- dictionary holds a **single copy** of each unique value

```
attrs = {'cs32':'a weeder', 'cs143':'practical'}

attrs['cs181'] = 'theoretical'
attrs['cs132'] = ['challenging','applied']
attrs['cs181'] = 'fascinating'

if 'cs181' in attrs:
  print(f"CS181 is known to be {attrs['cs181']}")

del attrs['cs181']    # remove key/value

for key, val in attrs.items():
  print(f'Key {key} maps to {val}')
------------------------------------------------
CS181 is known to be fascinating
Key cs32 maps to a weeder
Key cs143 maps to practical
Key cs132 maps to ['challenging', 'applied']
```

## Parameter Passing
- It has just one approach – and it's called "**pass by object reference.**"
- (And it's identical to pass by pointer in C++)

{: .note }
Every variable in Python is an object reference – it just holds the address of a value!

- When we call a function, Python just passes the object reference (pointer) to the function!
- The parameter is also an object reference (since it's just a variable).

### Parameter Passing Practice

Examples of creating a new object (so original object doesn't change): 
```
def nerdify(s):
 s = 'coding ' + s

i_like = 'parties'
nerdify(i_like)
print(i_like)

def peachify(f):
 f = f + ['peach']

fruits = ['apple', 'cherry']
peachify(fruits)
print(fruits)

def largeify(c):
 c = Circle(10)

unit = Circle(1)
largeify(unit)
print(unit.radius())
-------------------------
parties
['apple', 'cherry']
1
```

Examples of mutating the original object, so that the original object DOES change:
```
def peachify2(f):
 f.append('peach')

fruits = ['apple', 'cherry']
peachify2(fruits)
print(fruits)

def largeify2(c):
 c.set_radius(10)

unit = Circle(1)
largeify2(unit)
print(unit.radius())
-------------------------
['apple', 'cherry', 'peach']
10
```

### Keyword Arguments
- When you define a parameter with two asterisks `**`, this forces arguments to be passed to the function in a dictionary.
  - It's idiomatic to name this parameter `kwargs`.
- Each parameter name --> value is added to a dictionary, and the dictionary is passed to the function.

```
def foo(**kwargs): 
  for x,y in kwargs.items():
    print(x,"=>",y)
foo("carey"="nachenberg")
-------------------------
carey => nachenberg
```

## Handling Errors in Python
- When Python encounters an error that it doesn't know how to handle, it generates a special error called an "exception."
- If you don't add code to "handle" an exception, it will cause the program to **terminate**.
- Why? The function that "generated the exception" will immediately return, then the function that called it will immediately return, and so on, until your program exits!

We use `try` and `except` to handle errors in Python. 

```
#we can have the except in this function
def div(a, b):
  try:
    temp = a/b
  except: 
    return None #invalid result
  return temp

#we could also catch the error here
def main():
  try:
   result = div(10, 0)
   print(f'The result was {result}')
  except:
   print('You divided by zero!')

main() # call main function
```

Finally, we can even have multiple except blocks, each dealing with a different type of issue!

## Modules
- A **script** is a .py file that implements a main() function and is meant to run a stand-alone program. 
- Scripts are run from the command line, like this:
`python3 script_name.py`

- A **module** is a .py file that implements a set of related classes or functions for use as a library (e.g., for machine learning).
- Modules are intended to be imported into a python script or other modules to provide needed functionality.

### Importing Modules
You can "import" a module and use its function/classes in your programs.

Different ways to import modules:
```
import math

def hypot(a,b):
  return math.sqrt(a**2+b**2)
```
```
from math import sqrt, cos, sin

def hypot(a,b):
  return sqrt(a**2+b**2)
```
```
from math import *

def hypot(a,b):
  return sqrt(a**2+b**2)
```
```
import math as m

def hypot(a,b):
  return m.sqrt(a**2+b**2)
```
- Each module implicitly defines its own namespace (e.g., math).
- This prevents collisions between similarly-named functions/classes in different modules.

### Creating a Module
`our_shape.py`
```
class Circle:
 def __init__(self, radius):
  self.radius = radius

 def area(self):
  return 3.14 * self.radius**2
```
We import the module with `import our_shape`, since the file is called `our_shape.py`.
Then, we can create objects using the module's name as a prefix.
```c = our_shape.Circle(1)```

- We create larger Python programs using multiple modules

### Module versus Script
- A Python script is a .py file that's run from the command line.
- A Python module is a .py file that's **imported** by another .py file.

How can we tell? 

{: .note }
If you run a .py file from the command line, Python sets `__name__` to `__main__` indicating it's a script. Otherwise, Python sets `__name__` to the module's name.

## Functional Influences in Python

### Comprehensions

List Comprehension:
```
input = [10,11,12,15,17,22,23,5]
doubled_odds = [x*2 for x in input if x % 2 == 1] 
```
`s = "David's dirty dog drank dirty water down by the dam"`

Set Comprehension:

`wordz3 = {w for w in s.split() if w[0] == 'd'} # hint: set`

Dict Comprehension:
`wordz4 = {w:len(w) for w in s.split()}        # hint: dict`

Output:
```
[9, 16, 25]
{'drank', 'dam', 'dirty', 'down', 'dog'}
{"David's": 7, 'dirty': 5, 'dog': 3, 'drank': 5, 'water': 5, 'down': 4, 'by': 2, 'the': 3, 'dam': 3}
```
### Lambdas
```
def foo(f):
  print(f("Carey"))
  
def main(): 
  foo(lambda x : x + "has earwax") #returns "Carey has earwax"
  y = "a lot"
  foo(lambda x : x + "has earwax" + y) #returns "Carey has earwax a lot"
```
- The last lambda captures the `y` variable from the enclosing scope!

### Map, Filter, Reduce

**Map:** The map function returns a result object where f() has been applied to each of the original items.
input: 
- A function f() that accepts a single argument and returns f(arg).
-  An iterable object of items –  like a list, set, dictionary, etc...

```
print(map(lambda n : n**2, [1,2,3]))
-------------------------
[2, 4, 9]
```

**Filter:** 
The filter function returns a result object that includes all original items for which f() returned True.
input: 
- A predicate function f() that accepts a single argument and returns True/False.
-  An iterable object of items – like a list, set, dictionary, etc...

```
print(filter(lambda n: n % 2 == 0, [1,2,3,4]))
-------------------------
[2,4]
```

**Reduce:** The reduce function returns a single result that is the final accumulated value.
Requires `import functools`
Can either take in 2 or 3 inputs: 
- `f(accum, item)` takes in 2 arguments and returns a new accumulated value
- iterable object of items
- optional starting accumulated value (usually zero, empty string, empty list)
  - this starting value is placed before the second argument, if present; otherwise, it will start from the first element of the iterable object
  
```
from functools import reduce
adjs = ['nerdy', 'geeky', 'silly']
result = reduce(lambda x,y : y + ' ' + x, adjs)
print(result) #silly geeky nerdy
```
