## Variables and Types (continued)
### Variables and Scope
- in Python, once you define a variable, it stays in scope until function ends (unlike C++)

```
def foo(): 
  if True: 
    x = 10
  print(x)
foo()
----------------
10
```
### Range and Loops

- `range(x,y,z)` returns a sequence of integers between `[x,y)`, advacing by `z` each iteration (`z` is default 1).
  - `range(5,9,2)` => `[5,7]`
- `break` terminates a loop

## Classes
Instantiating a class `Car` and using an object of the `Car` class:
```
c1 = Car(16) #instantiation
c1.drive(10) #calling a method of the Car class
```

Class definition:
```
class Car:
  MILES_PER_GAL = 30
  def __init__(self, gallons):
    self.gas_gallons = gallons
    self.odometer = 0

  def drive(self, miles):
    gals_needed = miles / Car.MILES_PER_GAL
    if self.gas_gallons > gals_needed:
      self.gas_gallons -= gals_needed
      self.__update_odometer(miles)

  def __update_odometer(self, miles):
    self.odometer += miles

  def get_odometer(self):
    return self.odometer
```
- first param of each method must be `self` (`this` in C++)
  -  normal functions have no `self` param
-  constructor: `__init__`
-  we can't declare a class's member variables without assigning them (unlike C++)

_question:_ Why does changing `get_odemeter()` to: 
```
def get_odometer(self): 
  return odemeter
```
result in an error? 

_answer:_ We refer to class variables through `self.odometer` inside Python classes. `odemeter` now refers to a (non-existent) local variable!

_more classes_
- calling a method from another method: same as class variables, use the `self.` prefix
- private method: prefix with 2 underscores (`__update_odometer`); all other methods are public by default

{: .note }
Definition of a Python class is a sequence of statements, just like a regular Python program!
For example, this code is legal: 
```
  print('I like traffic lights')
  def drive(self,miles):
    print(f'I drove {miles} miles!')
  print ("As long as they're green")
```

## Objects
Python allocates objects using **object references**. 

Syntax: use the `.` dot operator to call methods through object references
```
c = Circle(10)
print(c.area())
```

- Every Python object is allocated on the heap (unlike C++, where we can choose between stack and heap)
- ALL variables are object references!
- even integer variables created through things like `i = 42` are object references that point to an integer value sitting in heap memory
  - in practice, you can view things like `i = 42 \n i = 10` as reassigning i's value when `i` is a primitive
  - under the hood, `i` first points to 42; then, a new object `10` is allocated on the head, and `i` changes its pointer to the new object

{: .note }
Every Python object is allocated on the heap, and then pointed to be an object reference.

### Object Construction

`c = Circle(10)`
- Before our constructor runs, Python allocates RAM for a new Circle object
  - `self` param of the object points at the newly reserved block of RAM
  - member variables are dynamically created and then assigned inside the block of RAM
- finally, the variable (object reference, in this case `c`) is assigned so that it points to the `Circle` object

_Question:_ Is every Python object of a given class guaranteed to have the same set of member variables? 
_Answer:_ No. Example:
```
def __init__(self, rad):
    self.rad = rad
    if rad > 100:
      self.really_big_circle = True
```

### Method Calling
`print(c.area())`
- when we call a method, Python passes the object reference to the `self` param

### Copying of Objects:
Assignment of object references means both object references will point to the same object! Hence, a change in one object, will affect both!

```
c = Circle(1)
c2 = c
c.set_radius(10) #c and c2 radius is BOTH changed to 10
```

Making a copy: 
```
import copy
c = Circle(1)
c2 = copy.deepcopy(c)
```

### Garbage Collection + Destructors:
- Python has automatic GC
- as long as some variables refer to an object, the object is kept around

Destructors: rarely used; if an object is garbage collected (not guaranteed), the destructor will automatically be called
- Python **automatically** frees allocated objects in C++, so we don't have to do that in Python destructors!

Destructor example
```
 def __del__(self):
    if self.book.finished_reading():
      print("You graduated!")
```

Destructors could be used to free a system resource that's not managed by GC. However, since we have no guarantee that the destructor will ever run, we should define our own _tear-down method_ and explicitly call it!

Example of an explicit tear-down method: 
```
  def delete_temp_file(self):
    self.tmpfile.close()         # closes file
    os.remove(self.tmpfile.name) # deletes file
```

### Inheritance
`class Student(Person)` -> derived class `Student` is inherited from base class `Person`

- you may re-define any method in derived class (methods are virtual by default)
- derived class can call any base class method with `super()` prefix
- make sure the derived constructor calls the base class constructor! `super().__init__(name)`

Example:
```
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  def talk(self):
    print('Hi!\n')

  def get_name(self):
    return self.name

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, name):
    super().__init__(name)
    self.units = 0

  def talk(self):
    print(f"Heya, I'm {super().get_name()}.")
    print("Let's party! Oh... and ")
    super().talk();
```
