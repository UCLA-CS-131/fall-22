## Typing continued
### Gradual typing
In [Lecture 7]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/07), we have seen both static and dynamic typing. There's actually a less well-known hybrid approach called gradual typing. It's used by a few well known languages like PHP and TypeScript, so it merits discussion. In gradual typing, some variables may have explicitly annotated types, while others may not. This allows the type checker to partially verify type safety prior to execution, and perform the rest of the checks during run time.

With gradual typing, you can choose whether to specify a type for variables/parameters. If a variable is untyped, then type errors for that variable are detected at run time. But if a variable is typed, then it's possible to detect some type errors at compile time. But what if we pass an untyped variable as an argument to a typed variable? Look at the following code snipped for a concrete example.
```python
def square(x: int):
  return x * x

def what_happens(y):
  print(square(y))
```
This is actually allowed in gradually typed languages! If you pass an untyped variable as an argument to `what_happens`, the type checker will check for errors during run time. This way, if you do use an invalid type, the program will generate an error the moment an incompatible type is detected.

Let's try and classify a language.
```kotlin
fun greet(name: String) {
  print("Hello, $name!") 
}


fun main() {
  var n = "Graciela";
  greet(n);
    
  n = 10; 
}
```
Is this language dynamically, statically or gradually typed, given that the code generates the following error?
```console
The integer literal does not conform to the expected type String
```
**Answer**: Even though it doesn't look like it at first glance, the language is statically typed, since you can't assign `n` to a value of a new type. This means that `n` has a fixed type, and that the language is using type inference. This language is actually Kotlin.

## Strong typing
Now that we have a good idea of static and dynamic typing, we're going to look at the various type checking approaches on the basis of strictness. A strongly typed language ensures that we will **never** have *undefined behaviour* at run time due to type issues. This means that in a strongly typed language, there is no possibility of an unchecked run time type error.

These are the minimum requirements for a language to be strongly typed:
- **The language is type safe**: This means that the language will prevent an operation on a variable `x` if `x`s type doesn't support that operation.
```cpp
int x;
Dog d;
a = 5 * d; // Prevented
```
- **The language is memory safe**: This means that the language prevents inappropriate memory accesses (e.g., out-of-bounds array accesses, accessing a dangling pointer)
```cpp
int arr[5], *ptr;
cout << arr[10]; // Prevented
cout << *ptr; // Prevented
```
These can be enforced either statically or dynamically.

Languages usually use a few techniques to implement strong typing:
- Before an expression is evaluated, the compiler/interpreter validates that all of the operands used in the expression have compatible types.
- All conversions between different types are checked and if the types are incompatible (e.g., converting an int to a Dog), then an exception will be generated.
- Pointers are either set to null or assigned to point at a valid object at creation.
- Accesses to arrays are bounds checked; pointer arithmetic is bounds-checked.
- The language ensures objects can't be used after they are destroyed.

In general, strongly typed languages prevent operations on incompatible types or invalid memory.

### Why do we need memory safety?
Why do strongly typed langauges require memory safety? To answer this question, consider the following example in C++ (a weakly typed language).
```cpp
// C++
int arr[3] = {10, 20, 30};
float salary = 120000.50;

cout << arr[3]; // out-of-bounds access
```
`arr[3]` actually access the value stored in `salary`, since all local variables are stored on the stack. So if a language is not memory safe, then it's possible to access a value (like `salary`) using an invalid type (`int` instead of `float`). Accessing a dangling pointer is another example of how memory safety can violate type safety.

| ![cpp-weak-type]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/lecture-notes/08/ram-image-weak-safety.png) |
| :--: |
| In C++, `arr[3]` would actually access the value stored in `salary` as if it were an integer! |

```cpp
// Accessing a dangling pointer
float *ptr = new float[100];
delete [] ptr;
cout << *ptr; // is this still a float?
```

### Checked type casts
A checked cast is a type cast that results in an exception/error if the conversion is illegal. Let's look at a concrete example in Java, a strongly typed language.
Consider the following snippet of code.
```java
public void petAnimal(Animal a) {
  a.pet(); // Pet the animal

  Dog d = (Dog)a; // Probably a dog, right?
  d.wagTail();    // It'll wag its tail!
}

...

public void takeCareOfCats() {
  Cat c = new Cat("Meowmer");
  petAnimal(c);
}
```
In this case, the program would output a type error saying that `Cat` can't be type cast to `Dog`.
```console
java.lang.ClassCastException: class Cat cannot be cast to class Dog
```
A similar snippet of code in C++ however would run, even though we are dealing with an object of type `Cat`, not `Dog`!
```cpp
void petAnimal(Animal *a) {
  a->pet(); // Pet the animal

  Dog* d = (Dog *)a;  
  d->wagTail();
}

...

void takeCareOfCats() {
  Cat c("Meowmer");
  petAnimal(&c);
}
```
When the C++ program actually executes `d->wagTail()`, anything could happen. This is *undefined behaviour* (we will cover undefined behaviour later in this lecture).

Why should we prefer strongly typed languages? Well, they have two main benefits.
- They dramatically reduce software vulnerabilities (e.g. buffer overflows).
- They allow for early detection and fixing of errors/bugs.

{: .note }
The definition of strong typing is disputed. Many academics argue for a stronger definition (e.g. all conversions between types should be explicit, the language should have explicit type annotations for all variables, etc.). But ultimately while these definitions may make a languages type system stricter, they don't impact the languages type or memory safety.

## Weak typing
Weak typing is essentially the opposite of strong typing, in that it **does not** guarantee that all operations are invoked on objects/values of the appropriate type.
Weakly typed languages are generally neither type safe nor memory safe.

### Undefined behaviour
In a strongly typed language, we know that all operations on variables will either succeed or generate an explicit type exception at runtime (in dynamically-typed languages). But in weakly-typed languages, we can have undefined behavior at runtime!
Undefined behaviour is the result of executing a program whose behaviour is prescribed as unpredictable in the language spec.
Consider the following example in C++.
```cpp
// C++ example w/undefined behavior!
class Nerd {
public:
  Nerd(string name, int IQ) { ...}
  int get_iq() { return iq_; }
  ...
};

int main() {
  int a = 10;
  Nerd *n = reinterpret_cast<Nerd *>(&a); // reinterpret the integer as a Nerd object
  cout << n->get_iq(); // ?? What happens?!?!?
}
```
When we call the `get_iq` method on `n` (which is actually an `integer`), the program is going to crash!

It's tough to say whether or not a language is weakly or strongly typed just from looking at it's behaviour in one situation. Consider the following example from a mystery language.
```perl
# Defines a function called ComputeSum
# In this language, @_ is an array that holds
# all arguments passed to the function

sub ComputeSum {
   $sum = 0;

   foreach $item (@_) {    # loop thru args
      $sum += $item;
   }
 
   print("Sum of inputs: $sum\n")
}

# Function call
ComputeSum(10, "90", "cat");
```
This outputs 
```console
Sum of inputs: 100
```
This may seem like the mystery language is weakly typed, but in fact the mystery language is Perl, which is strongly typed! Weak typing is the situation where an undefined result occurs because we apply some operation to a type that does not support it.  In Perl, the `+` operator does support the `string` type. It will convert the `string` to an `integer`, if possible (e.g., if it holds all digits). If not, it'll convert the `string` to a value of zero. Then it'll perform the add. So while Perl does perform implicit conversions which might not do what you want, its behavior is never undefined.

## Type casting, conversion and coercion
Type casting, conversion and corecion are different ways of explicitly or implicitly changing a value of one data type into another. For example, we can change the type of a variable using `static_cast`.
```cpp
void convert() {
  float pi = 3.141;
  cout << static_cast<int>(pi); 
}
```
Often the types you are converting will be related to each other, for instance like `float` and `double`. Both types hold real-valued numbers, but `double` can hold a much wider range of values and have a higher precision relative to `float` (at the cost of more memory). So in language theory, we say that `float` is a subtype of `double`, or alternatively that `double` is a super type of `float`.

More formally, given two types $T_{sub}$ and $T_{super}$, we say that $T_{sub}$ is a subtype of $T_{super}$ if and only if
- an object of type $T_{sub}$ can be used anywhere that code expects an object of type $T_{super}$.
- every element belonging to the set of values of type $T_{sub}$ is also a member of the set of values of $T_{super}$.

Does this mean `int` is a subtype of `long` in C++? Yes! Since all operations that can be performed on a `long` can also be performed on an `int` (+, -, \*, /, etc.) **and** every `int` value is also in the set of `long` values.
What about this example?
```cpp
class Person { ... };
class Nerd: public Person { ... };
```
Is `Nerd` a subtype of `Person`? Yes, since all operations that can be performed on a `Person` can also be performed on a `Nerd` **and** all `Nerd`s belong to the set of `Person`s. For a more tricky example, is `int` a subtype of `const int`? Yes, because all operations that can be performed on a `const int` can also be performed on an `int` and `int` and `const int` have the same set of values.

There are two ways of converting between types - *conversions* and *casts*
#### Type conversions
If we generate a whole new value of the new type, we say that we are performing a type conversion. The new value would occupy a different storage location and have a different bit representation.
```cpp
void convert() {
  float pi = 3.141;
  cout << (int)pi; // 3
}
```
This is a conversion since the compiler generates a new temporary value of a different type.

#### Type casts
If to convert a value's type, we just reinterpret the bits of the original value in a manner consistent with the new type, we say we are performing a type cast. In type casts, no new value is created.
```cpp
class Person { ... };
class Nerd : public Person { ... };

void cast() {
  Nerd n("Steph",110);
  Person &p = n;
  cout << "Hi " << p.getName();
}
```
In the above example, `p` refers to the original `Nerd` object, but interprets the bits as if it were a `Person`.

Conversions and casts can be *widening* or *narrowing*.
- Widening means the target type is a super type, and can fully represent the source type's values.
- Narrowing means the target type may lose precision or otherwise fail to represent the source type's values. The target type could be a subtype (like `long` and `short`), or the two types could also have a non-overlapping set of values (like `unsigned int` and `int`).

Conversions and casts can also be *expliict* or *implicit*.
- An explicit conversion requires the programmer to use explicit syntax to force the conversion/cast
- An implicit conversion (also called coercion) is one which happens without explicit conversion syntax.

{: .note }
An implicit conversion or cast that is widening is called a *type promotion*.

### Explicit conversions and casts
When you're using an explicit conversion or cast, you're telling the compiler to change what would be a compile time error to a run time check.
```java
class Example 
{
  public void askToCookFavoriteMeal(Machine m) {
    if (m.canCook() && m.canTalk()) {
      RobotChef r = m; // Line 5
      r.requestMeal("seared ahi tuna");
    }
  }
}
```
For example, at line 5, the programmer may know that converting from `Machine` to `RobotChef` is always safe, but a statically typed compiler can't know that. Therefore, the compiler will output an error. With an explicit cast (like in the example below), the compiler knows that the programmer wants to do this, and allows the code to compile.
```java
class Example 
{
  public void askToCookFavoriteMeal(Machine m) {
    if (m.canCook() && m.canTalk()) {
      RobotChef r = (RobotChef)m; // Line 5
      r.requestMeal("seared ahi tuna");
    }
  }
}
```
If the language is strongly typed, then it will perform a runtime check to ensure the type conversion is valid. In weakly typed languages, however, improper casts/conversions are often not checked at run time, leading to nasty bugs!

Here are a few examples of explicit type conversions in different languages.
- C++
```cpp
// Explicit C++ conversions
float fpi = 3.14;
int ipi = (int)fpi;               // old way  
int ipi2 = static_cast<int>(fpi); // new way 
RobotCook *r = dynamic_cast<RobotCook *>(m);
```

{: .note }
Ironically, even though `static_cast<int>(fpi)` is creating a new value (so it's performing a conversion), C++ calls it a cast

- Python
```python
# Explicit Python conversions
fpi = 3.14
ipi = int(pi)
```

- Haskell
```hs
-- Explicit Haskell conversion
fpi = 3.14 :: Double
ipi = floor(foo)     -- converts to 'Integral' super type
```

- JavaScript
```js
-- Explicit JavaScript conversion
fpi = 3.14
ipi = parseInt(pi) -- converts to int
```

#### Boxing and unboxing
A boxing conversion converts a primitive type into an object that holds only the primitive value as its member. Similarly, an unboxing conversinto converts a boxed object back to a primitive value. Let's see an example from Java.
```java
// Java - Explicit conversion of i to a boxed Integer
int i = 10;  // i is a primitive, stored on the stack
Integer boxed_i = new Integer(i); // boxed_i holds 10
  
// Explicit unboxing of the Integer to get its value
int unboxed_i = boxed_i.intValue();
```
`Integer` is Java's inbuilt boxed type. `boxed_i` is an `Integer` object with a single member, the `int` value. Calling `boxed_i.intValue()` returns the primitive `int` value.

{: .note }
Boxed primitives are used to store primitive values in Java containers (e.g., `ArrayList`) because its containers don't support unboxed primitives.

### Implicit conversions and casts
Most languages have a set of rules that govern implicit conversions that may occur without warnings/errors. For instance, here are some associated with C/C++ for coercion during binary operations (e.g., X + Y). When learning a new language, it helps to understand its implicit conversion policy!

| ![cpp-cast]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/lecture-notes/08/cpp-implicit-rules.png) |
| :--: |
| Type casting rules in C++ |

Let's look at some examples of implicit conversions and casts in different languages.

- C++

```cpp
// Implicit C++ conversions 
void foo(double x) { ... }

int main() {
  bool b = true;
  int i = b;  // b promoted to int
  double d = 
    3.14 + i; // i promoted to double
  i = 2.718;  // 2.718 coerced/narrowed to int
  foo(i);     // i promoted to double
}
```

When we promote `i` to `double` in the statement `double d = 3.14 + i;`, it brings the all of the operands to a common super type so that addition can be performed. In such an expression with mixed types, the types of all variables must have "type compatibility" with each other. 

{: .note }
In the above example, `i` is still an `int`, and it's value is `2`, not `2.718`. Compilers (especially recent ones) will often generate warnings for narrowing coercions which may not preserve the full source value.

- Python

```python
# Implicit Python conversions
i = 123 + True  # True promoted to int  (124)
f = 1.23
sum = i + f     # i promoted to float
```

- JavaScript

```js
// Implicit JavaScript conversion
str = "sk" + 8   // coercion of 8 to string
n = "10" * "15"  // coercion to numbers
```

- Java

```java
// Implicit (un)boxing in Java
int i = 10;
// implicit boxing
Integer boxed_i = i;  
// implicit unboxing   
int unboxed_i = boxed_i; 
```

{: .note }
Haskell doesn't do implicit type conversions.

### Type casting in depth
Casting is when we reinterpret the bits of the original value in a manner consistent with a different type. No new value is created by a cast, we just interpret the bits differently. The most common type of casting is from a super type to a subtype, for example, when upcasting from a subclass to a super class to implement polymorphism. Downcasting is another example, where we go from a super class to a subclass.
```cpp
// C++
class Mammal { ... }
class Person : public Mammal { ... };
class Nerd: public Person { ... };

void ask_hobbies(Person &p) { ... }

void date_with_nerd(Nerd &n) {
  ask_hobbies(n); // upcast Nerd to Person
}

void date_with_mammal(Mammal &m) {
 // downcast Mammal to Person
 Person& p = dynamic_cast<Person &>(m);
 ask_hobbies(p);
}
```
Here is an example of implicit casting.
```cpp
// C++
void print(unsigned int &val)
 { cout << val << endl; }

int main() {
   int j = -42;

   print(j);  // prints 4294967254
}
```
This cast simply reinterpretes the value stored by `j` as if it were an `unsigned int`.

{: .note }
Many compilers will *not* warn about implicit casts when they are between unsigned and signed types - even though they are narrowing.

```cpp
// C++
void print(const string &s)
 { cout << s << endl; }

int main() {
   string s = "UCLA";

   print(s);
}
```
This cast implicitly converts from type `string` to `const string`.

We can also use casting to change the interpretation of pointers and read/write memory using a different type. For example, consider the following snippet of code in C++.
```cpp
void cast() {
  int a = 1078530000;
  int *ptr = &a;
  // Treat ptr as a float *
  cout << *reinterpret_cast<float *>(ptr); // prints 3.14159
}
```
The code treats `ptr` as if it is a pointer to a `float` (using `reinterpret_cast`), and when we dereference ptr, the bits are interpreted as if they were a `float`.

We can also reinterpret the value of an integer as a pointer (though this isn't recommended).
```cpp
void cast() {
  int a = 12340;
  // Treat a as a double pointer
  // Store value of pi at address 12340!
  *reinterpret_cast<double *>(a) = 3.14159;
}
```
So what's better, explicit or implicit type conversions? It depends! Explicit type conversions lead to more verbose code and is less convenient, but reduces the likelihood of bugs. Implicit type conversions makes code less verose and is more convenient, but greatly increases the likelihood of bugs.

Here are a few final examples of casting and conversions.
```perl
$a = 5;
if ($a) {
    print("5 is true!");
}
```
From this snippet of code, we can infer that the language supports type coercion, since it does a narrowing coercion from an integer value `5` to a boolean value `false`.

{: .note }
The language is actually Perl.

In the following example, we are told that the program doesn't work if we remove the `float32` conversion.
```go
func main() {
  var x int = 5
  var y float32 = 10.0 
  var result float32

  result = float32(x) * y // doesn't work if we remove float32()
  fmt.Printf("5 * 10.0 = %f\n", result)
}
```
From this, we can infer that the language requires explicit conversions between even comparable types (like `int` and `float`).

{: .note }
The language is actually Golang.
