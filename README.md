**Hey there! This is the source code for the Fall 2022 CS 131 course website. It is built with:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)-based static site generator
- [just-the-docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/), a Jekyll theme providing the base styling and structure
- [just-the-class](https://kevinl.info/just-the-class/), a template that extends just-the-docs for class-specific features
