## Project 1

Project 1 has been released! It is due at **11:59 PM PT on October 23rd**. Some links that you'll find helpful:

- [Project 1 Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Q4EPgHLMlMuQABhmgTpk_Ggxij0DZwvPQO2uzVVPzk)
- [Project Autograder](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/fall-22-autograder) - **includes test cases!!**
- [Project Starter Template](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/fall-22-proj-starter)
- [Gradescope Submission](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/444425/assignments/2345373)

*Note*: we're trying a new approach of highly interactive project grading, where you:

- get a subset of your project graded **immediately on submission**
- are able to run a copy of the grading server locally
- get a subset of the test cases that we grade your project on
- put everything on GitHub!

Since this is new, please let us know how effective this is, and how we can improve it. We want to see you succeed!
