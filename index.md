# UCLA CS 131 - Fall 2022

Welcome to the course website for the Fall 2022 offering of CS 131 at UCLA.

{: .warning }

As Fall 2022 has passed, this website is no longer updated. Please direct any concerns to Matt at [matt@matthewwang.me](mailto:matt@matthewwang.me).

{: .note }

During the latter half of Fall 2022, [UC Academic Workers went on strike](https://dailybruin.com/tag/uc-academic-worker-strike-2022). Among other things, this affected website maintenance and course material development.

Some things that you can do:

- [read the syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/syllabus)
- view the [course calendar]({{site.baseurl}}/calendar) for every lecture, discussion, homework, and exam for the quarter
- use the [weekly schedule]({{site.baseurl}}/schedule) to find professor and TA office hours
- read TA-written [lecture notes]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures) that add on existing slide content
- view [project specs and canonical solutions]({{site.baseurl}}/projects)
  - this includes our [open-source autograder](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/fall-22-autograder)
- see [homework due dates and solutions]({{site.baseurl}}/homeworks)
- ~~stalk~~ learn more about our wonderful [staff]({{site.baseurl}}/staff)


We're working to make this site a better experience for you as a student. If you have any suggestions, feel free to:

- let us know (in class, via Campuswire, or otherwise)
- [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/fall-22/issues), or make a PR!
